           <h2><em> <strong>Ticket Purchase Policy</strong> </em></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tickets purchased on the Website or via qarsak.com or its
                subsidiaries.
              </li>

              <li>
                In most cases payment in full for the Ticket is made at the time
                of purchase, and the Ticket is dispatched to the Customer via
                email or text message shortly after purchase has completed. In the Event that
                payment is made fraudulently using a lost/stolen credit/debit
                card or the credit/debit card is used without the permission of
                the card owner, qardak.com reserves the right to cancel such
                Tickets purchased without refund to the fraudulent purchaser.
              </li>
             
              <li>
                Qarsak.com or Attan.com may require the Customer to provide
                proof that they are the original purchaser of the Ticket at the
                point of entry to the Event in the form of acceptable original
                photo ID such as a passport, driver's license, national ID card
                and/or by presenting the original credit/debit card used to
                purchase the tickets. In the Event that more than one ticket is
                purchased by the Customer for the same Event, then all members
                of the Customer's party attending the Event should enter the
                Event at the same time with the Customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is the responsibility of Customers to protect their tickets
                from loss or theft. Qarsak.com is not responsible for the
                replacement of lost or stolen Tickets, and does not issue
                refunds for lost or stolen Tickets. This applies to
                electronically issued Tickets as well as printed Tickets. In the
                Event a Customer's electronic Ticket is copied/stolen (e.g. via
                hacked email, or through delivery to a shared email address) and
                the Ticket is used and scanned before the Customer enters the
                Event, the Customer will be refused entry as the Ticket will
                have been cancelled at the time of first use. No refund will be
                offered to the Customer in this case. Customers are strongly
                advised to protect their electronic Tickets with the same
                caution and care they would protect a physical printed Ticket
                from theft.

                It is the Customer's responsibility to check whether there are
                any restrictions placed on entry to the Event, such as age
                restrictions or dress code restrictions, before purchasing a
                Ticket from the Website. Qarsak.com will not be held liable and
                will not refund the Ticket purchase if entry to the Event is
                declined by the Promoter for any reason including, but not

                All Tickets are issued subject to the Rules and Regulations of
                the venue and the Event. It is the responsibility of the
                Customer to abide by such Rules and Regulations and to
                familiarize themselves with the Rules and Regulations before
                purchasing a Ticket.

              <li>
                In all cases The Promoter and the venue management reserves the

                If a Customer is ejected from an Event by the Promoter, its
                agents, or by the venue management or security then the Customer
                shall not be entitled a refund under any circumstances.
              </li>
              <li>
                Many venues operate a strict "no re-entry" policy, meaning that
                if the Customer leaves the venue during the Event they will not
                be permitted back into the venue using their original Ticket. It
                is the Customer's responsibility to familiarize themselves with
                the re-entry policy of the Event before entering. No refunds
                will be issued to Customers who leave a venue during an Event
                and are refused re-admission because of the no re-entry policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                The venue management or the Promoter may restrict what items are
                brought into the Event, including but not limited to food,
                beverages, cameras, video and audio recording equipment,
                seating, selfie sticks, and items considered unlawful,
                hazardous, dangerous or potential weapons. Qarsak.com will not
                be held liable and will not refund the Ticket purchase if entry
                to the Event is declined or a Customer is ejected by the
                Promoter or venue management for bringing, or attempting to
                bring, a restricted item into the venue. Furthermore Qarsak.com
                accepts no responsibility or liability for items confiscated by
                the Promoter or venue management.
              </li>
              <li>
                Qarsak.com, the venue management and the Promoter accept no
                responsibility or liability for items lost or stolen or injury
                incurred at the Event.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Customer's responsibility is to attend the Event at the
                correct time, and on a valid date. The Customer's responsibility
                is to check that the Event is due to take place on the original
                published date and at the original published time. Qarsak.com
                accepts no responsibility or liability for any loss, whether
                actual or implied, due to the Customer failing to check the date
                and time of the Event prior to travelling to the Event.
              </li>
            
              <li>
                It is the responsibility of the Customer to attend the Event on
                time. Some venues and Promoters will refuse entry to latecomers.
                No refunds will be issued to latecomers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Many Events will have a "last admission" time, meaning the
                latest time a Customer can enter the Event. The last admission
                time is generally earlier than the end time of the Event. It is
                the responsibility of the Customer to ascertain the last
                admission time. If a Customer is refused entry for an Event
                because they arrive at the Event after the last admission time,
                qarsak.com will not issue a refund.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most venues prohibit the unauthorized use of photographic and
                recording equipment. Please check with the Promoter and venue
                before arriving at the Event.
